    {
        id: 39,
        question: "What is Dependency Injection?",
        answer: "Dependency Injection is a design pattern where an object receives other objects that it depends on (dependencies) rather than creating them internally. This promotes loose coupling and makes testing easier."

    {
        id: 41,
        question: "How does a Database Index work?",
        answer: "An index is a data structure (like a B-Tree) that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table at the cost of additional writes and storage space. It works like a book's index."
    },
    {
        id: 42,
        question: "Sharding vs Replication?",
        answer: "Replication copies data across multiple servers to improve availability and read performance. Sharding partitions data across multiple servers (e.g., users A-M on Server 1, N-Z on Server 2) to handle more write load and storage."
    },
    {
        id: 43,
        question: "Explain Caching Strategies (Write-through vs Write-back).",
        answer: "Write-through updates the cache and the database simultaneously, ensuring consistency but slower writes. Write-back updates only the cache (fast writes) and syncs to the DB later, risking data loss on crash."
    },
    {
        id: 44,
        question: "What is a CDN?",
        answer: "A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a distributed network of servers that delivers pages and other web content to a user based on their geographic location, the origin of the webpage, and a content delivery server."

    },
    {
        id: 46,
        question: "What happens when you type a URL in the browser?",
        answer: "DNS resolution translates URL to IP; Browser initiates TCP handshake; specific query sent via HTTP/HTTPS; Server processes and sends back response (HTML); Browser parses HTML and requests assets (CSS/JS); Page renders."
    },
    {
        id: 47,
        question: "CSRF vs XSS?",
        answer: "XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) injects malicious scripts to run in a victim's browser. CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) tricks a logged-in user into performing an unwanted action on a trusted site."
    },
    {
        id: 48,
        question: "How to prevent SQL Injection?",
        answer: "Use Prepared Statements (Parameterized Queries) which treat user input as data, not executable code. Also, perform input validation and sanitization."
    },
    {
        id: 49,
        question: "What is Docker and how does it differ from a VM?",
        answer: "Docker uses containers to package an app with its dependencies. Containers share the host OS kernel and are lightweight, whereas VMs run a full guest OS and are heavier."

        answer: "OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework. Common flow: User clicks 'Login with Google'; App requests auth code; User approves; App exchanges code for Access Token; App uses Token to access user data."
    },
    {
        id: 52,
        question: "Symmetric vs Asymmetric Encryption?",
        answer: "Symmetric uses the same key for encryption and decryption (faster, key sharing risk). Asymmetric uses a public key to encrypt and a private key to decrypt (slower, safer key exchange)."
    },
    {
        id: 53,
        question: "How are Hash Map collisions handled?",
        answer: "Common methods are Chaining (storing a list/linked list at the bucket index) and Open Addressing (probing for the next available slot). Java's HashMap uses chaining with linked lists or Red-Black trees."
    },
    {
        id: 54,
        question: "What is Dynamic Programming?",
        answer: "Dynamic Programming determines the optimal solution by breaking a problem into overlapping subproblems and storing the results (memoization) to avoid redundant computations (e.g., Fibonacci, Knapsack)."
    },
    {
        id: 55,
        question: "BFS vs DFS?",
        answer: "BFS (Breadth-First Search) explores neighbors level by level (good for shortest path). DFS (Depth-First Search) explores as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking (good for puzzles, topological sort)."
    },
    {
        id: 56,
        question: "Singleton Pattern - pros and cons?",
        answer: "Ensures a class has only one instance. Pros: Controlled access to sole instance. Cons: Global state can make testing difficult and hide dependencies; hard to run in parallel environments."
    },
    {
        id: 57,
        question: "Observer Pattern?",
        answer: "Defines a one-to-many dependency so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. Heavily used in Event Handling systems."
    },
    {
        id: 58,
        question: "How do you handle a production outage?",
        answer: "1. Acknowledge and communicate. 2. Rollback recent changes if suspected. 3. Isolate the issue (check logs, metrics). 4. Apply fix. 5. Monitor. 6. Post-mortem analysis to prevent recurrence."
    },
    {
        id: 59,
        question: "What is a 502 Bad Gateway error?",
        answer: "It indicates that a server acting as a gateway or proxy received an invalid response from an upstream server. Often means the application server is down or timed out."

    {
        id: 60,
        question: "Explain the concept of 'idempotency' in REST APIs.",
        answer: "Idempotency means that making multiple identical requests has the same effect as making a single request. For example, GET, PUT, and DELETE are idempotent, while POST is usually not."
